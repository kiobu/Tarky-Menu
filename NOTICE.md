# OpenTarkovMenu Deprecation

Good news for everyone (maybe), SSH has agreed to open-source his mod with the caveat that the mod will be hosted on the Nexus rather than the Hub. As I only originally created this fork to be a FOSS version of TarkyMenu, I am deprecating this fork in favor of his. If at some point in the future, SSH locks down his source code again, I will unarchive my fork and continue maintaining it again. 

Yes, after only around 24 hours, OpenTarkovMenu comes up, and is taken down again. Sorry to everyone anticipating my fork of TarkyMenu (all 3 of you), but SSH made the entirety of the mod, and is agreeable in my open-source stipulations, so I'm very happy to point everyone there instead.

I will not be linking the mod here, as it is a violation of Hub policies to link to a third-party site, but if you want TarkyMenu, the official way to get it from SSH is from Nexus Mods' EFT page.
